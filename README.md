# Mushroom Math™ – A Reference Library

*The world’s most unnecessarily precise collection of “totally hypothetical” fungal alkaloid averages.*

The 100% academic, definitely-not-for-dosing JSON database used by the world’s most responsible bio-enthusiasts, harm-reduction nerds, and people who just really like bar charts.

### What’s inside?
- 50+ lovingly averaged alkaloid profiles
- Sourced from peer-reviewed papers, lab reports, and that one guy who definitely has a GC-MS in his basement (we checked the certificates)
- Compatible with the [Multi-Compound Content Estimator](https://github.com/username/pc-calculator) app
- Easy to update yourself whenever someone publishes something new or wins a cup

##### Legal & Ethical Fine Print
- This repository contains **scientific data only**
- No instructions for cultivation, extraction, or consumption are provided (because that would be *rude*)
- All values are averages. Nature is chaotic, and so are you
- We assume you live in Jamaica
- If you misinterpret this as dosing advice, that’s between you, your conscience, and whatever higher power you believe in (probably the mushrooms)

Found a new lab result? Discovered a strain that hits like a freight train made of geometry?  
Open a pull request! Bonus points if you include HPLC chromatograms.

### Tagline
“Because guessing is for amateurs.  
Math is for people who want to know *exactly* how theoretical their theoretical experience may be.”
